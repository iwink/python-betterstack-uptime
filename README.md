# Python Betterstack-Uptime
![coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-85%25-green)

`betterstack-uptime` is a library written in python that can assist in dealing with the Betterstack Uptime API. This is done by converting API endpoints into python objects, and translating the attributes from the API into variables. 

#### Current endpoints implemented
- Monitors
- Monitor SLA
- Monitor Groups
- Heartbeats
- Heartbeat Groups
- Incidents

In future, there will be more endpoints added. These however, will need some extra code in order for them to work properly. If you desperately need another endpoint, feel free to extend the `BaseAPIObject` class, and implement it!

`betterstack-uptime` is free and [open source](https://github.com/iwink/python-betterstack-uptime) software, you are free to use it, share it, modify it and share the modifications with the world. 

## Getting Started

### Requirements

You will need the following software:
- `python>= 3.7`

Older versions of python 3 should work, but are not guaranteed to work. 

### Installing

Run the following command to install the package
```bash
pip install betterstack-uptime
```
### Usage

Just some quick boilerplate code to get you started

##### Get all instances
```python
from betterstack.uptime import UptimeAPI
from betterstack.uptime.objects import Montitor

api = UptimeAPI("yourtokenhere")
monitors = Monitor.get_all_instances(api=api)

for monitor in monitors:
    print(monitor.url)
```
